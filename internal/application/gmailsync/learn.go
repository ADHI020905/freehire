// The self-learning ATS-domain cache. It closes the overfitting trap of the
// hardcoded allowlist: instead of a human adding every niche ATS domain seen in
// one inbox, a domain earns its place after its mail is confidently classified as
// job-application mail PromoteThreshold times, and keeps it only while at most
// MaxOtherShare of its mail is classified `other`. BuildQueryFor then unions the promoted
// domains into the sync query, so coverage grows from real classifications.
//
// Wiring (two seams): the write side — mailclassify/maillink calls RecordJobMail
// with the sender when it confidently labels an email as an application, and
// RecordNonJobMail when it labels one `other` — and the
// read side — the sync Worker loads Promoted() and passes it to BuildQueryFor. The
// DB adapter over the learned_ats_domains table (migrations 0036, 0185) implements
// LearnedDomainStore.

// PromoteThreshold is how many confident job-mail sightings a domain needs before
// it joins the sync allowlist. Above 1 so a single misclassification can't promote
// a newsletter domain.
const PromoteThreshold = 3

// MaxOtherShare bounds how much of a domain's mail may be classified `other` for it to stay
// promoted. A promoted domain's whole mailstream joins every user's query, so the hit count
// alone learned senders that mail a few hiring messages among many others — on prod,
// google.com (98% `other`) and linkedin.com (87%). Real recruiter and ATS domains measured
// under 20%; a third leaves headroom without keeping a mostly-noise sender.
