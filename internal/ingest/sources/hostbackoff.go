// A Retry-After honoured per REQUEST is not enough once a crawl runs eight boards at once: the
// request that drew the 429 waits, and the other seven keep firing into the same refusal. That
// is how a workable run turned one tripped budget into ~1,500 failed boards in three minutes
// (2026-10-18; its refusal-retry client returns on the second refusal with no wait at all), and
// it is the same mechanism that let join's retries go out on top of its pacer. The hold is per
// host, shared by every request this Client makes, so the whole crawl slows the moment the
// platform says so — and boards the run then never reaches keep their last state instead of
// recording a failure each.
//
// A refusal after a hold has expired doubles the next hold, up to max; the refusals of one burst
// count once. A served response resets the escalation (it does not shorten a hold already set,
// which other workers are already waiting out).
