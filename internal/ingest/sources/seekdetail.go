// seekDetailNetwork is the one GraphQL jobDetails client the whole SEEK network shares: seek
// (AU/NZ) and jobstreet (JobStreet/JobsDB) answer the same operation from the same
// infrastructure, and a ban one of them provokes is a ban on both (2026-10-15: www.seek.com.au,
// sg.jobstreet.com and th.jobsdb.com all refused jobDetails at once). It is built once per
// registry and handed to both adapters, the same way the single pacedSeekPoster was.
//
// It owns three run-scoped decisions no single board can make:
//
//   - which egress LANE a detail request takes: the direct IP first, then — after the first
//     RATE_LIMITED refusal on it — the proxy, which has its own pacer (see seekProxyDetailInterval);
//   - when to STOP hydrating: a refusal on the proxy lane too, or a refusal on the direct lane with
//     no proxy configured, ends detail traffic for the rest of the run;
//   - how many requests the run may SPEND at all (budget, see seekDetailRunBudget).
//
// A posting that gets no body because the network stopped is deferred exactly like a failed
// detail (seek never stores a posting body-less), so a stopped run costs latency, not data.
//
// The state is per process, and cmd/ingest crawls one provider per process — so in production the
// shared budget and the shared stop bind within a run of one provider; nothing carries a ban
// across runs, which is deliberate: every run re-probes the direct IP, and the budget bounds what
// that probe can cost if the ban is still in force.

// not a per-second one, since the rate itself had been clean for a month. 1,500 is about a third
// of the LOW end of that range and ~12.5 minutes at the direct pace. Runs come every 2 hours, so
// it still drains up to ~18k new postings a day per provider against a steady state of a few
