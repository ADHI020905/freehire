// dkSponsorURL is SIRI's list of companies certified for the Danish Fast-track
// scheme, which lets them hire a foreign skilled worker without the ordinary
// case-by-case permit route. A single stable page, like the IND register; it moved
// under SIRI's glossary section in 2026, and the old /Applying/Work/ address 404s
// without a redirect.
//
// The list is narrower than "employers that sponsor": a Danish company can hire
// through the Pay Limit or Positive List schemes without certification, so the
// credential's copy names the scheme rather than claiming the whole country.

// is an error: the table failing to render means the page changed, and returning
// nothing would reconcile the credential off every company.
